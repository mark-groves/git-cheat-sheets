## üí£ Breaking Changes

Use `!` to indicate a breaking change:
```bash
feat(api)!: change output format to JSON
```

### Full Format with Body and Footer
```bash
feat(api)!: change report output format to JSON

Previous XML format is deprecated and will be removed in v3.0.
New format provides better performance and easier parsing.

BREAKING CHANGE: The /v1/report endpoint now returns JSON instead of XML.
Update your client code to parse JSON responses.

Closes #123
```

### Breaking Change in Footer Only
```bash
refactor(database): optimize user query performance

Improve query speed by 80% through better indexing
and query restructuring.

BREAKING CHANGE: user.getAll() method signature changed
from getAll(limit) to getAll(options)
```

---

## üìÑ Multi-line Commits

Use longer commits for complex changes that need explanation:

### Feature with Body
```bash
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 integration

Add support for Google and GitHub OAuth2 providers.
This includes token refresh logic and user profile
synchronization. Fallback to local auth remains available.

Closes #245
Refs #190
```

### Bug Fix with Body
```bash
fix(payment): resolve race condition in checkout

Payment processor was sometimes called twice when users
double-clicked the submit button. Added debouncing and
state management to prevent duplicate transactions.

The fix includes:
- Button state management
- Request deduplication
- Error handling improvements

Fixes #456
```

### Refactor with Detailed Explanation
```bash
refactor(api): extract user validation into middleware

Move user validation logic from individual controllers
into reusable middleware. This reduces code duplication
and makes validation consistent across all endpoints.

Changes:
- Create validateUser middleware
- Update all user-related controllers
- Add comprehensive validation tests
- Update API documentation

No functional changes to existing behavior.
```

## üë• Co-authored Commits

Use when working with others (pair programming, collaboration):

### Single Co-author
```bash
feat(ui): redesign user dashboard

Complete overhaul of the user dashboard with improved
navigation and responsive design.

Co-authored-by: Jane Smith <jane@example.com>
```

### Multiple Co-authors
```bash
fix(database): optimize complex reporting queries

Refactor expensive queries and add proper indexing
to improve report generation performance by 75%.

Co-authored-by: John Doe <john@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Jane Smith <jane@example.com>
```

### Full Format with Co-authors
```bash
feat(security)!: implement two-factor authentication

Add TOTP-based 2FA for enhanced account security.
Users will be prompted to set up 2FA on next login.

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication flow now requires
2FA verification for all admin users.

Co-authored-by: Security Team <security@example.com>
Closes #789
```

## üîÑ Common Workflows

### Feature Branch Workflow
```bash
# Start feature
feat(user-profile): add avatar upload functionality

# Incremental commits
feat(user-profile): implement image validation
feat(user-profile): add image resizing and optimization
test(user-profile): add avatar upload test suite
docs(user-profile): update API documentation for avatars

# Final commit
feat(user-profile): complete avatar upload implementation

Merge branch 'feature/user-avatars' into main
```

### Hotfix Workflow
```bash
# Emergency fix
hotfix: resolve critical payment gateway timeout

Production payment gateway experiencing timeouts due to
increased traffic. Implement circuit breaker pattern
and increase timeout values.

Fixes #URGENT-001

# Follow-up improvement
perf(payment): optimize gateway connection pooling

Reduce connection overhead and improve reliability
for high-traffic scenarios.

Related to hotfix commit abc123
```

### Bug Fix with Investigation
```bash
fix(email): resolve template rendering error

Email templates were failing to render due to missing
variable sanitization. Investigation revealed that
user input wasn't being properly escaped.

Root cause: Missing HTML encoding in template engine
Solution: Add XSS protection and input validation

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create email with special characters in subject
2. Send email through template system
3. Observe rendering failure

Fixes #567
Tested-by: QA Team <qa@example.com>
```

## üìè Commit Message Guidelines

### Subject Line Rules
- **Length**: Maximum 50 characters (GitHub truncates at 72)
- **Mood**: Use imperative mood ("Add", not "Added" or "Adds")
- **Case**: Start with lowercase after type (conventional style)
- **Punctuation**: No period at the end
- **Content**: Describe what the commit does, not what you did

### Body Guidelines
- **Width**: Wrap at 72 characters for better readability
- **Separation**: Blank line between subject and body
- **Content**: Explain *what* and *why*, not *how*
- **Lists**: Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple items
- **Paragraphs**: Separate concerns with blank lines

### Footer Guidelines
- **References**: Link to issues, PRs, or external resources
- **Breaking Changes**: Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` keyword
- **Co-authors**: Use `Co-authored-by:` for collaboration
- **Other**: `Signed-off-by:`, `Reviewed-by:`, `Tested-by:`

### Length Examples

```bash
# Perfect length (49 chars)
feat(api): add user authentication middleware

# Too long (67 chars) - will be truncated
feat(api): add comprehensive user authentication middleware system

# Better alternative - move details to body
feat(api): add user authentication middleware

Implement comprehensive authentication system with
JWT token validation, role-based access control,
and session management.
```

## ü™ù Git Hooks

### Pre-commit Hook for Message Validation

Create `.git/hooks/commit-msg`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Validate commit message format

commit_regex='^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|security|hotfix|wip|revert)(\(.+\))?(!)?: .{1,50}'

if ! grep -qE "$commit_regex" "$1"; then
    echo "‚ùå Invalid commit message format!"
    echo "Use: type(scope): description"
    echo "Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, security, hotfix, wip, revert"
    echo "Max 50 characters for subject line"
    exit 1
fi

# Check subject line length
subject=$(head -1 "$1")
if [ ${#subject} -gt 50 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Subject line too long (${#subject} chars, max 50)"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Commit message format is valid"
```

### Make Hook Executable
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

### Pre-commit Hook for Code Quality
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Pre-commit checks

echo "üîç Running pre-commit checks..."

# Check for TODO/FIXME in staged files
if git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l "TODO\|FIXME" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Found TODO/FIXME in staged files"
    echo "Consider addressing them or use 'wip:' commit type"
fi

# Prevent commits to main branch
branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if [ "$branch" = "main" ] || [ "$branch" = "master" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Direct commits to $branch are not allowed"
    echo "Create a feature branch instead"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Pre-commit checks passed"
```

### Global Git Hooks Setup
```bash
# Set global hooks directory
git config --global core.hooksPath ~/.githooks

# Create global hooks directory
mkdir -p ~/.githooks

# Copy your hooks to global directory
cp .git/hooks/commit-msg ~/.githooks/
chmod +x ~/.githooks/commit-msg
```
